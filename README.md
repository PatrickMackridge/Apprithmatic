# Apprithmetic

Apprithmetic is a random equation generating, brain training quiz app for Android. Written in Java, it generates random equations and waits for the user input. If the answer is correct it adds to your current correct answer streak, if it's wrong it sets your streak back to zero. Use it to brush up on your mental maths skills when you find yourself with a spare few minutes!

## Installing on Android

To get Apprithmetic on your Android phone: 
1. Navigate to this repo in your phone's browser. 
2. Head over to the Releases section (which should be at the bottom of the main page of this repo) and download the 'Apprithmetic1.0.apk' file under the Assets tab. 
3. Once this is downloaded, locate the APK on your phone and click on the file to install the app. You may get a warning from Android that it doesn't recognise the source of the APK, but click install anyway - I promise it's all safe!
4. Apprithmetic should now be installed on your phone.
5. Get solving those equations!

## Run the project locally

If you want to have a play around with the source code feel free to fork this repo to your own GitHub account. 
- To import this project into Android Studio, open up AS and select File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub.

- Once the project has been imported connect your Android device via USB, select it from the Android Studio device menu and click Run to run the app on your phone. 

Feel free to add to your own version of the app, although at this time I'm not looking for any outside contributions to the original repo. Thanks!

### Happy quizzing!
